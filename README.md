## About this project
I was tasked with building a JavaScript file to randomly generate a password with certain parameters such as including special characters, numbers, upper and lowercase letters and set in between 8-128 characters. I did this by using several functions and for loops and also using the eventListener to watch for clicks on the generate button

## Summary
I was able to get the password to generate with all parameters and also stop the script if there were no selections of parameters for the password
